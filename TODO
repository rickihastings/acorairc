// TODO LIST
// 
// Update as you wish, this is just a roadmap/reminder thing!
//

* core::check_unused_chans() broken, commented out for the time being. This is quite a critical function in freeing unused data, so priority.
* Reasonable testing on inspircd 1.2
* Parse modes from capab replacing $modes_p_unrequired, $modes_params and $restrict_modes, as these CAN change, and shouldn't really be defined in the ircd protocol
* Also parse prefix's from capab and putting them into $prefix_modes as they can change with newer inspircd modules ! etc
* Stabalise inspircd2.0
