// TODO LIST
// 
// Update as you wish, this is just a roadmap/reminder thing!
//

* core::check_unused_chans() broken, commented out for the time being. This is quite a critical function in freeing unused data, so priority. (DONE)
* Parse modes from capab replacing $modes_p_unrequired, $modes_params and $restrict_modes, as these CAN change, and shouldn't really be defined in the ircd protocol (DONE INSPIRCD12)
* Do the same above for other protocol modes (gonna be a pain!)
* Fix an issue with global.os module, on_connect looks like (DONE)
* Fix an issue with empty data being put in recv(): log (DONE)
* Also parse prefix's from capab and putting them into $prefix_modes as they can change with newer inspircd modules ! etc (DONE)
* Parse MAXMODES into $max_params (DONE)
* Parse m_hidechans.so, as we do need this, well not need but certainly should be using it! atm it just crashes without it (can parse it in ircd, don't want to as it means editing all, but probably should because not all ircd's use modules for modes like this (and some even use different modes!))
* Report an error and boot when module isn't found, instead of crashing
* Fix bug with /os global
* Fix bug with /cs levels #channel displayed wrong message for unidenfied users (DONE)
* Fix bug with levels being given out if you arn't identified
