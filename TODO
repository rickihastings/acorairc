// TODO LIST
// 
// Update as you wish, this is just a roadmap/reminder thing!
//

* core::check_unused_chans() broken, commented out for the time being. This is quite a critical function in freeing unused data, so priority. (DONE)
* Parse modes from capab replacing $modes_p_unrequired, $modes_params and $restrict_modes, as these CAN change, and shouldn't really be defined in the ircd protocol (DONE INSPIRCD12)
* Fix an issue with global.os module, on_connect looks like (DONE)
* Fix an issue with empty data being put in recv(): log (DONE)
* Also parse prefix's from capab and putting them into $prefix_modes as they can change with newer inspircd modules ! etc (DONE)
* Parse MAXMODES into $max_params (DONE)
* Parse m_hidechans.so, as we do need this, well not need but certainly should be using it! atm it just crashes without it (can parse it in ircd
  don't want to as it means editing all, but probably should because not all ircd's use modules for modes like this (and some even use different modes!)) (DONE)
* Report an error and boot when module isn't found, instead of crashing (DONE)
* Fix bug with /os global (DONE)
* Fix bug with /cs levels #channel displayed wrong message for unidenfied users (DONE)
* Fixed more bugs with levels not setting certain modes on folk, like +v *@* (DONE)
* Fix bug with levels being given out if you arn't identified (DONE)
* Add the option to turn chanserv's guard off via config file (silly git, this is already possible so, DONE)
* Do some work on /cs flags #channel, as it could show alot more info, like /cs info (DONE)
* Add +r to channels upon register, can't believe we don't actually do this? (DONE, but it can be unset by operserv, i'm going to leave it like this.
  incase someone wants to "pretend" a channel isnt registered, for whatever reason)
* Add charybdis33 support (DONE)
* Redesign how services::check_mask_ignore() works, at currently it doesnt work so is commented out. (DONE)
* Redesign all handlers, so they send information rather than $ircdata, cause its inprecitable what state it's going to come in (DONE)
* Add chanserv invite
* Add an identified parameter to core::$nicks, will save using queries in some instances. Mainly to fix a bug in charybdis though (DONE)
* Port logout.ns into identify.ns, because having logout with no identify is pointless? (DONE)
* Convert !help op to /cs help op, and so fourth (DONE)
* Add a confirm code protection to DROP to ensure it's not accidently used
* Look into bans being set upon burst, we currently can't see this happening, charybdis uses BMASK, not sure what insp uses. fix! (DONE)
* Add mass mode command, convert mode::type_mask to use this and also levels, this allows setting a tonne of modes together compressed (DONE)
